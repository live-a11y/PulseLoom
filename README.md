\# PulseLoom



PulseLoom is a small experimental tool for real-time control and OSC signal sequencing.



It was developed to fill a specific gap in my own creative workflow,

mainly for driving and coordinating external systems during audio and visual work.



Basic familiarity with OSC-based workflows is assumed.



This project is provided as-is.

If it happens to be useful for your setup, feel free to try it.

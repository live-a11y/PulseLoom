## What it does
PulseLoom helps you design and play back control timelines (curves/events) that drive external engines via OSC.
It sits between your ideas and your sound engine (Max/Csound/SuperCollider/etc.) as a focused control layer.

## Key features
- Track-based sequencing (multiple lanes / targets)
- Automation-style curves for smooth parameter changes
- Per-track OSC routing (target / port / address)
- MIDI input control (external controllers to drive/modify actions/parameters)
- Session save/load for repeatable setups
